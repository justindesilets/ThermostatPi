ThermostatPi
============
Esentially this will be a fork of the work done by Bertrand Zauhar http://ve2zaz.net/RasTherm/RasTherm.htm. He has written up an excellent tutorial documenting his setup. As a learning experiment I'm looking to build off this work and tailor some of the featues to suit my own needs. I am on building off this code with the permission from Bert and will working on and realeasing all code under the most open source model I can agree to. I will update this after I've had time to read through all the different models and find one that best suits my ideals.

Current State
=============
At first I was going to try and just work the UI and keep it looking like a traditional thermostat setup. I've changed my mind and am now working on making it into more of a mobile UI friendly design. The UI design is moving pretty well but I already knew how to do a lot of that coding. I'm starting to run up against the python bits and it is going to require me to keep learning new bits of python to keep putting these pieces together. So far it has been fun and interesting.
