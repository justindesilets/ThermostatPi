ThermostatPi
============
Esentially this will be a fork of the work done by Bertrand Zauhar http://ve2zaz.net/RasTherm/RasTherm.htm. He has written up an excellent tutorial documenting his setup. As a learning experiment I'm looking to build off this work and tailor some of the featues to suit my own needs. I am on building off this code with the permission from Bert and will working on and realeasing all code under the most open source model I can agree to. I will update this after I've had time to read through all the different models and find one that best suits my ideals.

Current State
=============
None of the software shown right at the moment is modified. I will update this notation as soon as I get all the hardware and can start experimenting on the build. So for now I would look to Bert's website for the best guidance.
